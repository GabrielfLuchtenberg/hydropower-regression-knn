## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The notebook ingests historical hydropower consumption data, preprocesses it, and then employs the KNN regression model to predict the consumption for the year 2019. Various metrics, such as Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE), R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and more, are used to evaluate the model's performance.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **File Name:** `Hydropower_Consumption.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains yearly hydropower consumption data. The data for each country spans from the year 2000 to 2019. The notebook specifically drops the `Country` column and scales the data between 0 and 1 using `MinMaxScaler` for modeling purposes.

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies

To run the notebook, you'll need the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jorgesandoval/hydropower-regression-knn.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the cloned directory and open the Jupyter notebook"**

    ```bash
    cd hydropower-regression-knn
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. **Run the notebook**: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the KNN model, and evaluate its performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
* The notebook performs a search to determine the optimal number of neighbors (k) for the KNN regressor.

* A grid search is conducted to further refine the model parameters.

* The final model's performance metrics are displayed at the end of the notebook.
